# Privacy Policy for WeatherSense

WeatherSense uses only the information you choose to provide during a conversation, such as a ZIP code or latitude/longitude, to retrieve weather forecasts and alerts.

Location information is used solely to request current weather data from public weather services, including the U.S. National Weather Service. WeatherSense does not store, sell, or share personal data beyond what is necessary to return weather information.

WeatherSense does not automatically collect device location, IP addresses, or identifiers. All location input is voluntary and provided directly by the user within the chat.
